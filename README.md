### RUSTO!

## HOW TO RUN

cargo build to download dependencies

Run main in src to start. cargo run should do.

To play, hit "D, F, J, K" keys to the beat.

The higher your accuracy, the better your score will be!

## HOW IT WORKS

Beat maps are made in .map files in /assets/beatmaps. Check testmap.map for example

Song file names are specified in the .map file, however make sure to put the .mp3 file in /assets/audio/songs

**Note that there is not support for beatmap selection yet, so if you want to add a map make sure to remove testmap.map
